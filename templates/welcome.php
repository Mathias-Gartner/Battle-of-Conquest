	<p>BOC is short for "Battle of Conquest", a game that is being planed and produced by studends of FH Technikum in Vienna. To begin with, BOC is a strategy-game and that means that it has to provide all the needs of these kind of games. Logical thinking and well timed actions are the keys to have success. Attacking without plans or timing will only hurt the attacker. Additionally wasting all the ressources will not profit the player in any way. The army is one of the best things to help the player which means it has to be strong. The main target-group are young people who have a soft spot and love for strategy-games.
